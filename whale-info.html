    <h2>1. BLUE WHALE</h2>
    <p>The blue whale, the largest animal to have ever lived on Earth, can reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as 200 tons. These magnificent creatures are found in oceans across the world and primarily feed on krill. Despite their enormous size, blue whales have a gentle nature and communicate using low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances underwater. Their populations are still recovering from the days of commercial whaling, and they are now listed as endangered.</p>

    <h2>2. HUMPBACK WHALE</h2>
    <p>The humpback whale is known for its long pectoral fins and complex songs that can be heard over vast distances. These whales are migratory, traveling thousands of miles between feeding and breeding grounds. Humpbacks are known for their acrobatic behavior, such as breaching and tail slapping. They primarily feed on small fish and krill and are famous for their cooperative hunting techniques, such as bubble-net feeding. They are found in oceans worldwide and are considered a conservation success story due to their population recovery after whaling.</p>

    <h2>3. ORCA (Killer Whale)</h2>
    <p>Orcas, or killer whales, are powerful predators found in oceans worldwide. They are actually the largest members of the dolphin family, known for their striking black and white coloration. Orcas are highly social and live in matrilineal groups called pods. These whales are apex predators, preying on fish, seals, and even other whales. They have a wide range of vocalizations and are highly intelligent, using complex hunting strategies that involve teamwork and coordination.</p>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>4. SPERM WHALE</h2>
    <p>The sperm whale is famous for its massive head and distinctive spermaceti organ, which is thought to help with echolocation and buoyancy control. These whales are found in deep ocean waters and are known for their deep dives, which can last over an hour as they hunt for squid, including the giant squid. Sperm whales have a social structure, with females and calves forming groups while males tend to live solitary lives. They have been featured in literature and are often associated with the book Moby-Dick.</p>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>5. BELUGA WHALE</h2>
    <p>Beluga whales are easily identifiable by their white coloration and lack of dorsal fin. These small, social whales are found in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters, often living in estuaries and coastal areas. Belugas are known for their vocalizations, sometimes referred to as the "canaries of the sea," due to their wide range of sounds. They feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans and are highly adaptable, able to navigate through ice-covered waters during winter.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Known for their white coloration and vocalizations.</li>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>6. FIN WHALE</h2>
    <p>Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, after the blue whale. Known for their slender bodies and sharp dorsal fins, these whales are found in both deep and coastal waters. They are fast swimmers and can reach speeds of up to 23 miles per hour. Fin whales primarily feed on krill and small fish and are known to be migratory. They are found in oceans worldwide and are often considered a success story in whale conservation, with their numbers slowly recovering.</p>

    <h2>7. MINKE WHALE</h2>
    <p>The minke whale is the smallest of the baleen whales, but they are still quite large, measuring up to 35 feet long. These whales are found in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, often near coastlines or in colder waters. Minke whales feed on small fish, krill, and plankton and are known for their curiosity, often approaching boats and ships. They are considered a common whale species, although they are still hunted in some regions, despite international bans on commercial whaling.</p>
