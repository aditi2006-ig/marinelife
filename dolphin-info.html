    <h2>1. BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is one of the most well-known and widely distributed species of dolphin, found in both warm and temperate seas worldwide. These dolphins are highly intelligent, social animals and are known for their playful behavior and complex communication skills. They typically have a robust, streamlined body with a prominent, rounded "bottle-shaped" snout (which is how they got their name), and their coloration ranges from light gray to dark gray with a lighter underside.

Bottlenose dolphins are often seen in groups called pods, which can range from a few individuals to several dozen. They are carnivorous, feeding primarily on fish, squid, and crustaceans, and they employ sophisticated hunting techniques, including cooperative strategies. Known for their curiosity and ability to interact with humans, they are frequently featured in marine parks and have been studied for their advanced problem-solving abilities and communication.

They are also capable of using tools and displaying social bonds, making them one of the most studied marine mammal species.</p>

    <h2>2. KILLER WHALE (Orca)</h2>
    <p>The killer whale (Orcinus orca), also known as the orca, is the largest member of the dolphin family. These highly intelligent and powerful marine mammals are recognized by their striking black and white coloration, with a black back, white underside, and distinctive white patches above and behind their eyes. They can grow up to 32 feet (9.8 meters) in length and weigh as much as 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms).

Killer whales are apex predators and have a diverse diet, feeding on fish, squid, seals, and even large whales. They are known for their complex social structures, living in tight-knit groups called pods, which can include as few as a few individuals or as many as 40. Orcas are known for their cooperative hunting strategies, where members of a pod work together to capture prey, demonstrating impressive communication and teamwork.

Widely distributed in oceans around the world, killer whales are highly adaptable and have been observed in various marine environments, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Despite their fearsome reputation, they are not considered a threat to humans in the wild.

    <h2>3. COMMON DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is one of the most widespread and abundant species of dolphin found in warm, temperate oceans around the world. Characterized by its slender body, it has a striking color pattern, with a dark gray or blue-gray back, a lighter underside, and a distinctive hourglass-shaped patch of yellow or light gray on each side. These dolphins typically reach lengths of 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.5 meters) and weigh between 130 to 200 pounds (60 to 90 kilograms).

Common dolphins are highly social and often found in large groups, known as pods, which can range from a few individuals to several hundred. They are known for their playful behavior, often riding the bow waves of boats and performing acrobatic leaps out of the water. They are also skilled hunters, feeding on fish, squid, and small marine creatures, using sophisticated hunting techniques, including cooperative hunting in groups.

Highly intelligent, common dolphins have complex communication systems, using clicks, whistles, and body movements to interact with each other. They are often seen in both coastal and offshore environments, and their friendly nature has made them a favorite among marine enthusiasts and researchers.</p>

    <h2>4. SPOTTED DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) is a medium-sized species of dolphin known for its distinctive spotted coloration, which becomes more pronounced as it ages. These dolphins typically have a light to dark gray body with darker spots on their back, sides, and underside, giving them their characteristic "spotted" appearance. The spots can vary in shape and size, with older individuals often showing more spots. They usually grow to around 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.5 meters) in length and weigh between 150 to 200 pounds (68 to 90 kilograms).

Spotted dolphins are highly social and are typically found in large groups, often in pods of 20 to 100 individuals, although they can sometimes form larger superpods. They are known for their playful behavior and acrobatic displays, including leaping, spinning, and riding the waves.

These dolphins are distributed in warm, tropical, and subtropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They feed primarily on fish and squid, using sophisticated hunting strategies and working cooperatively in their pods. Spotted dolphins are known for their high intelligence and complex communication skills, making them one of the most studied dolphin species.

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>5. SPINNER DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The spinner dolphin is a small, highly acrobatic species found in tropical and subtropical oceans, particularly around the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Known for their remarkable spinning leaps, they can rotate their bodies up to seven times in a single jump, which is how they earned their name. These dolphins are slender with a long, narrow beak, and typically have a light gray or silver body with darker patches along the back and sides, often with a lighter underside.

Spinner dolphins are social animals, often seen in large groups, called pods, that can range from a few individuals to several hundred. They are known to form close-knit social bonds and frequently engage in playful behaviors like riding the bow waves of boats. They feed on small fish and squid, hunting at night in deep waters. Spinner dolphins are known for their high intelligence and complex vocalizations, including whistles, clicks, and other sounds used for communication and echolocation.</p>

    <h2>6. DOLPHIN STRIPED DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The striped dolphin is a medium-sized species of dolphin found in warm and temperate oceans, particularly in the Atlantic and Pacific. These dolphins are easily recognizable by their distinctive, bold stripe patterns: a dark blue or black stripe runs from the eye to the tail, and another stripe extends from the dorsal fin down the sides of their body, creating a striking contrast with their lighter gray or white underside. They typically grow to about 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) in length and weigh around 200 to 300 pounds (90 to 140 kilograms).

Striped dolphins are active and social animals, often found in large pods, which can number from a few dozen to several hundred individuals. They are known for their energetic behavior and can frequently be seen jumping, leaping, and riding the bow waves of boats. They feed mainly on fish, squid, and other small marine organisms, hunting cooperatively in groups. Striped dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistles, and body language, and they are also known for their speed and agility in the water.</p>

  <div class="animal-description">
    <h2>7. RISSO'S DOLPHIN</h2>
    <p>The Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) is a distinctive species of dolphin known for its large size and unique appearance. It typically has a robust, stocky body with a large, rounded head and a prominent dorsal fin. Risso's dolphins are usually gray or white, with older individuals often displaying extensive scarring and lighter pigmentation due to interactions with other dolphins and prey, as well as from their environment. They grow to lengths of 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) and can weigh up to 1,100 pounds (500 kilograms).

Risso's dolphins are generally found in deep, offshore waters and are commonly seen in temperate and tropical oceans, particularly in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They are social animals and usually travel in small groups or pods, though sometimes larger aggregations are observed. Their diet consists mainly of squid, and they are known for their ability to dive to significant depths to hunt.

These dolphins are relatively calm and less acrobatic compared to other dolphin species, though they can be seen breaching or tail-slapping on occasion. Risso's dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks and whistles, and their advanced social structure helps them coordinate group activities, such as hunting.
